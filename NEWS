Dec 31, 2007: Release 0.3.2
===========================

Bug fixes:

This release fixes a bug in the python bindings whereas send_keys() was not
always returning a value.  It also fixed a bug in how mouse events get
propagated and ensures that the right number of encodings are sent to the
server.  This release also fixes the RichCursor encoding when the server is
using a depth of less than 24.

New features:

A new interface was added (vnc_display_send_keys_ex) for passing key press and
key release sequences directly and for sending pointer events directly
(vnc_display_send_pointer).  Another interface was added
(vnc_display_set_read_only) to prevent the user from being able to send any
input at all to the server.  Support for the RRE encoding was added along
with a GThread-based coroutine implementation to improve portability.  ZRLE
support was also added.

Dec 13, 2007: Release 0.3.1
===========================

Bug fixes:

Fix build so that generated tarball contains all the necessary files after a
make dist.

Dec 12, 2007: Release 0.3.0
===========================

Bug fixes:

This release fixes a number of build issues on Solaris.  It
also fixes cursor grabbing, a potential race during connect(),
an SELinux error, and race condition in the coroutine library.

New features:

Interfaces for bell messages and the clipboard are now supported.
RFB 3.4 is now supported for increased compatibility with UltraVNC.

Sep 13, 2007: Release 0.2.0
===========================

Bug fixes:

This release fixes compatability with mixed endianess client
and servers and BGR/RGB pixel format displays. Mixed colour
depths are now correctly accounted for & converted appropriately.
Graceful shutdown is now handled correctly, interrupting any
pending I/O waits. Added destructor to widget to ensure all
resources are free'd when the widget is deleted.

New features:

The two common client cursor offload extensions are supported
for compatability with OSX-VNC, UltraVNC and TightVNC. Support
for Vino's TLS authentication method is added. Added signals
for getting notified of desktop resize events, and authentication
failures.
