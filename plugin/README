  README for plugin
  ==========================
  by Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com>

This is a web browser plugin featuring a Gtk VNC widget which can be
embedded in a web page.

This code is primarily an example of how to write such a plugin.  You
could use it directly, but it's more likely that you'll want to
customise it for particular situations.

The plugin supports all browsers which supply the NPAPI and XEmbed
APIs.  This includes all modern Mozilla/Firefox-derived browsers on
Unix, and [untested] WebKit-based browsers (eg. Konqueror, Safari) and
Opera.

All the code is based on Adobe's demonstration XEmbed-based browser
called DiamondX (http://multimedia.cx/diamondx/).

Building
--------

The code is not enabled by default.  To enable, at the top-level
directory do:

  ./configure --enable-plugin

You will need the following APIs/header files for this to work:

  npapi.h           (from a Firefox or Mozilla development package)
  npupp.h

  gtk/gtk.h

  X11/Xlib.h        (X11 development package)

  NSPR              (Netscape Portable Runtime development package)

Other plugins usually come with their own npapi.h and npupp.h, copied
from the Mozilla source code.  However since in Fedora we ship a
'firefox-devel' package which contains these headers (albeit in a
rather inconvenient location), I have not duplicated them here.

If configuration was successful then the usual 'make' at the toplevel
will build the plugin (gtk-vnc-plugin.so).

Installing
----------

The 'make install' rule installs the plugin (gtk-vnc-plugin.so) in the
site-wide Mozilla plugins directory ($libdir/mozilla/plugins).

For a single user install you can also do this:

  cp gtk-vnc-plugin.so $HOME/.mozilla/plugins

For other browsers, you'll need to find out where they keep their
plugins.

Testing
-------

Restart your browser.  In the location bar, type:

  about:plugins

Amongst your other plugins you should see the GTK-VNC plugin:

  GTK-VNC plugin

  File name: gtk-vnc-plugin.so
  VNC (remote desktop) viewer plugin

  MIME Type              Description    Suffixes        Enabled
  application/x-gtk-vnc  VNC viewer     gtk-vnc         Yes

If that appears, then next edit the test.html page in the current
directory.  You will need to change the source of this page to point
to a working VNC server (eg. a machine on your local network).

Then load the edited 'test.html' page into your browser, and you
should see a VNC widget and the desktop of the remote server.

Embedding
---------

The basic embedding HTML code is:

  <embed type="application/x-gtk-vnc"
    width="800"
    height="600"
    host="192.168.2.129" port="5900">
  </embed>

Both host and port are required, otherwise the plugin (currently)
won't do anything.

Future work
-----------

* Try to get it working in other browsers.
* Compile on Windows.
* Get desktop-resize working properly.
* Allow remote control from Javascript.
* Allow authentication methods to be specified as parameters.

Security
--------

Obviously if you have this plugin, then any web page could invoke it,
which would entail a VNC connection to any IP address/port
combination, including addresses which are behind firewalls.  As it
stands, this doesn't seem like very much risk because (1) Gtk-VNC will
only talk to VNC servers which respond with the appropriate VNC
greeting, and (2) in any case the web page can't query the plugin to
see if the connection was successful.

Security will become an issue if the plugin is extended to allow
control / status from Javascript.  You might want to think about
having a whitelist of sites which are allowed to use the plugin.
