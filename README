   GTK VNC  Readme
   ===============

gtk-vnc is a VNC viewer widget for GTK. It is built using
coroutines allowing it to be completely asynchronous while
remaining single threaded. It provides a core C library, and
bindings for Python (PyGTK)

The API is still in early stages of development & so until
version 1.0 is declared, the API may change. The primary
public API is provided by the vncdisplay.h class & should
be reasonably free of API churn. The other header files are
internal VNC protocol implementation & will very likely change.

Installation caveats
--------------------

 * NetBSD: You must run configure using

    --with-coroutine=gthread

   since any app linking against NetBSD's libpthread.so is
   forbidden from using swapcontext() calls, which is gtk-vnc's
   default coroutine impl. For further information see

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566148
    http://man.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?pthread++NetBSD-current

 * MinGW: The SASL protocol extension is not available on
   this platform
