   GTK VNC  Readme
   ===============

gtk-vnc is a project providing client side APIs for the
RFB protocol / VNC remote desktop technology.

It is built using coroutines allowing it to be completely
asynchronous while remaining single threaded. It provides
two core C libraries, libgvnc for interacting with the core
RFB protocol and libgtk-vnc for a GTK display widget.

There is a traditional Python binding built on PyGTK, and
evolving support for arbitrary languages via the GObject
Introspection system.

Installation caveats
--------------------

 * GTK3: The build defaults to using GTK2. To enable GTK3 support
   the flag '--with-gtk' must be passed to configure.

         ./configure --with-gtk=3.0

   NB: the traditional python bindings are disabled when gtk3
   is used. Applications should use the GObject introspection
   bindings instead.

   NB: when built against GTK3, the library name for gtk-vnc
   will become 'gtk-vnc-2.0.so' and the pkg-config file will
   also be 'gtk-vnc-2.0'.  The gvnc library is unaffected.

 * NetBSD: You must run configure using

    --with-coroutine=gthread

   since any app linking against NetBSD's libpthread.so is
   forbidden from using swapcontext() calls, which is gtk-vnc's
   default coroutine impl. For further information see

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566148
    http://man.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?pthread++NetBSD-current

 * MinGW: The SASL protocol extension is not available on
   this platform
