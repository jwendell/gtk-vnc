   GTK VNC  Readme
   ===============

gtk-vnc is a VNC viewer widget for GTK. It is built using
coroutines allowing it to be completely asynchronous while
remaining single threaded. It provides a core C library, and
bindings for Python (PyGTK)

The API is still in early stages of development & so until
version 1.0 is declared, the API may change. The primary
public API is provided by the vncdisplay.h class & should
be reasonably free of API churn. The other header files are
internal VNC protocol implementation & will very likely change.
